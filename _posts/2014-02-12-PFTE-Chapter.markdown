I am happy to announce that [Benjamin Van Ryseghem](benjamin.vanryseghem.com) and I finished the documentation of Spec for the Pharo For The Enterprise book.
This documentation is up-to-date with the latest version of Spec, and is focused towards people wanting to use it and even extend it.
We hope that this text will help all the people that are building UIs in Pharo, and it will clear up any doubts that they may have.

The chapter is available in source form from the GitHub project of the [Pharo For The Enterprise book](https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PharoForTheEnterprise-english).

The easiest way to read the chapter is from the continuous integration server, which produces a html file of the chapter [here](https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/PharoForTheEnterprise/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/Spec/Spec.pier.html).

We tried our best to make it understandable and complete, but if you have any doubts or comments please do not hesitate to let us know !!
You can find the pier files on GitHub<sup><a href="https://github.com/spec-framework/documentation"><i class='fa fa-github-alt'></i></a></sup>, where you can also report issues or propose fixes.

Now it's time to build some cool user interfaces! <i class='fa fa-smile-o fa-2x'></i>

PS from Ben: I would like to personally thank [Sean P. DeNigris](http://seandenigris.com) for his surprise pull requests.
