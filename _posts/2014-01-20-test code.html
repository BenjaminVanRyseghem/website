I am glad to announce this super website dedicated to Spec and the things related to this cool framework <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.

You will find here the Spec documentation as well as a news feed about Spec progresses.

If you want to collaborate, the website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SpecForPharo/website"><i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a>.

{% codeblock lang:smalltalk Coffeescript Tricks start:51 mark:51  %}

Thank you all!
